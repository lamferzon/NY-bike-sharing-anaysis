	abstract={Functional spatio-temporal data naturally arise in many environmental and climate applications where data are collected in a three-dimensional space over time. The MATLAB D-STEM v1 software package was first introduced for modeling multivariate space-time data and has been recently extended to D-STEM v2 to handle functional data indexed across space and over time. This paper introduces the new modeling capabilities of DSTEM v2 as well as the complexity reduction techniques required when dealing with large data sets. Model estimation, validation and dynamic kriging are demonstrated in two case studies, one related to ground-level air quality data in Beijing, China, and the other one related to atmospheric profile data collected globally through radio sounding.},

	title={Multivariate hidden dynamic geostatistical model for analysing and mapping air quality data in Apulia, Italy},
	volume={48},

	abstract={In this work we propose the multivariate extension of a spatio-temporal model known in the literature and we deduce its maximum likelihood estimator based on the EM algorithm. An illustrating example concerns the joint modeling of air quality and meteorology in Apulia region, Italy. In particular a 8-variate model is fitted for daily particulate matters (PM10) and nitrogen dioxides (NO2) concentrations and six non colocated meteorological variables, without the need of preliminary data interpolation. Some preliminary evidence of the model capability to detect a Saharan dust event is also given. We propose an extension of a univariate hierarchical model with a Markovian latent geostatistical component, which was introduced in the literature as the dynamic spatio-temporal model. Since it is given by a Markovian sequence of spatial random fields plus a measurement error, in this paper we refer to as the hidden dynamic geostatistical model, or HDG model. In the frame of large datasets, a semi-parametric variant of the HDG model was introduced as the fixed rank smoothing spatio-temporal random effect model (FRSSTRE). The univariate HDG has been addressed by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques and some comparison studies showed its good performance in both cases. For estimation and prediction we develop an HDG extension of the D-STEM software which is able to handle multiple variables with heterogeneous spatial supports, covariates, heterotopic monitoring networks and missing data. Uncommon in the EM literature, also the standard deviation of parameter estimates are available. In the air quality example, concentration maps and the related uncertainty maps are estimated in order to highlight the potentiality and usefulness of the proposed approach in the context of official environmental communication.},
