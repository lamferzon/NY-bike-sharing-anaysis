\section{Scientific questions}

The aim of this study is to analyse the bike sharing phenomena in Jersey City by using a statistical approach which involves the use of spatio-temporal models to describe the number of pickups and the mean trip duration (the observed variables) at each of \num{51} stations at a specific time instant. Specifically, the goals are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{inference}: how the weather variables, events and the distance between every bike sharing station and the nearest subway/train station (the covariates) can help us to describe the observed variables? Which are the most significant covariates?
	\item \textbf{models validation}: fixed some bike stations, which is the best spatio-temporal model among those we are taken into account in predicting the time series regarding the pickups and the mean trip duration of these test stations?
\end{itemize}
