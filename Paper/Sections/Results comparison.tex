\section{Results comparison}

After having analysed the results coming from estimates of the DCM and HDGM, i.e. the unique ones for which we have employed model selection, we can summarize that most significant common covariates in explaining the number of daily pickups at rental stations are feels-like temperature, rainfall, distance and UV index, instead to describe the trip duration are feels-like temperature, UV index and dummy holidays. In table \ref{RMSE_final_comp} we can notice that, both for RMSE$_t$ and RMSE$_s$, the best model in predicting pickups is the f-HDGM in terms of both mean and standard deviation, i.e. it is not only the model which makes the smallest mean validation error, but also its RMSE is the one with the least dispersion. Moreover, we can note that HDGM performs better respect to DCM; the reason could be the following: the former contains only a single latent component, i.e. $\boldsymbol{z}(\boldsymbol{s}, t)$, instead the latter in addition has also $\boldsymbol{w}(\boldsymbol{s}, t)$, therefore it depends less on training data respect to DCM, i.e. it has less probability to fall into overfitting. Finally, regarding trip duration the best spatio-temporal model is DCM.
