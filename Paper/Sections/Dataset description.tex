\section{Datasets description}
The original bike sharing dataset\footnote{it is possible to download it from this web page: \url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vineethakkinapalli/citibike-bike-sharingnewyork-cityjan-to-apr-2021}.} comes from the website Kaggle and contains the bicycle rental information in \num{2020} of the company Citi Bike in the Jersey City. Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City. The weather dataset, instead, contains the most significant meteorological variables' time series about NYC in \num{2020} and comes from the historical weather data database that the website Visual Crossing\footnote{more information at this web site: \url{https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data}.} makes available for the users. Moreover, we have constructed two logical dummy variables to describe the weekends and events that have occurred in New York City in \num{2020}, i.e. the US federal holidays and the lockdown due to the COVID-\num{19} pandemic.
Through a preliminary data processing work, we have extracted from the original datasets the variables of our interest by grouping data in order to obtain daily and hourly information. In the following paragraphs we have summarized some information about them.

\subsection{Bike sharing variables}
This partition contains all the information relating to the bike rental:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{pickups counters}: number of rentals at a station (figure \ref{Trend});
	\item \textbf{mean trip duration}: mean rental time at station (figure \ref{Trend});
	\item \textbf{mean users age}: mean age of the users who rent at a station;
	\item \textbf{male counters}: number of male users at a station;
	\item \textbf{female counters}: number of female users at a station;
	\item \textbf{unknown gender counters}: number of people who have not specify their gender at a station;
	\item \textbf{subscribers counters}: number of customers who have an annual subscription;
	\item \textbf{customers counters}: number of customers who have \num{4}-hour pass or \num{3}-day pass;
	\item \textbf{distance}: indicates the distance between a rental station and the nearest train or subway station in \unit{\kilo\meter}. (figure \ref{Map})
	
\end{itemize}
All this data is sampled hourly and daily, except for the distance that is a time-invariant variable, which we have entered by carrying out an in-depth analysis of the means of public transport in the area, with the hypothesis that it may influence the demand for rentals.

	\caption[]{the maps summarizes our area of interest. On the left, the black squares indicate the means of transport stations, the dots indicate the bike sharing stations, the colorbar describes the distance from the nearest means of transport station. On the right, it is the public transport map from which we have obtained the coordinates of the main stations, in particular in blue is the route of the path service which reaches Manhattan, in yellow is the NJ transport service which extends over the entire Jersey area.}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Weather variables}
Also in this case the weather variables are sampled in discrete time with daily and hourly frequency and they are thus defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{mean temperature}: in \unit{\degreeCelsius};
	\item \textbf{mean feels-like temperature}: in \unit{\degreeCelsius} (figure \ref{T_plot_box});
	\item \textbf{relative humidity}: in percentage;
	\item \textbf{rainfall}: in \unit{\milli\meter} (figure \ref{Rain_plot_box});
	\item \textbf{snowfall}: in \unit{\centi\meter};
	\item \textbf{mean wind speed}: in \unit{\kilo\meter/\hour};
	\item \textbf{cloud cover}: describes the percentage of covered sky;
	\item \textbf{visibility}: describes the maximum distance of visibility in \unit{\kilo\meter}. In the absence of fog there is a field of vision of \num{16} km;
	\item \textbf{UV index}: indicates the energy of UV rays with a dimensionless variable ranging from \num{1} to \num{10}.
\end{itemize}
The reason why we have taken into consideration the weather variables is because it's easy to think that the weather can influence a person's choice of rent or not rent a bike. For example, we report two plots that showing how some meteorological variables affect rentals.

On bottom there is the trend of two weather variables in green line, on left is indicated the average feels-like temperature, on right there is the rainfall. The light red patch describes the lockdown period. It is easy to observe that the weather variables have a strong influence, in particular the temperature has a positive effect on the rentals, on the contrary the amount of rainfall has a negative impact. Unfortunately the lockdown breaks these considerations, probably because many people didn't have the possibility to rent a bike}

\subsection{Dummy variables}
As already mentioned, we hypothesize that some events may influence the demand for bike rentals, especially the presence of lockdowns or the presence of public holidays. So we have defined the following binary dummy variables:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{lockdown}: this is equal to \num{1} if there are restrictions in New York City, due to Covid and \num{0} if there are none;
	\item \textbf{holidays}: is equal to \num{1} when it is Saturday, Sunday or when there is a public holiday, \num{0} on the remaining days.
\end{itemize}
