\subsection{f-HDGM}

\subsubsection{Analysis of relevance of the latent component $\boldsymbol{z}(\boldsymbol{s}, t)$}
 Due to the high computational time which the estimate of the f-HDGM requires, it was not possible to employ the stepwise approach to perform the model selection, therefore starting from the most relevant regressors identified through the estimate of an OLS model, we have built three models with a different number of covariates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{large}: \num{9} regressors, i.e. feels-like temperature, rainfall, visibility, wind speed, cloud cover, distance and dummy variables; 
	\item \textbf{medium}: \num{4} covariates, i.e. feels-like temperature, distance and dummy variables;
	\item \textbf{small}: \num{2} regressors, i.e. feels-like temperature and dummy lockdown.
\end{itemize}
 In each of them we have also introduced a constant in order to allow \textbf{D-STEM} to estimate through the EM algorithm the mean number of hourly bike rentals. The aim of this study is to determinate how the relevance of the latent component $\boldsymbol{z}(\boldsymbol{s}, t)$ changes as the number of covariates, i.e. the dimension of $\boldsymbol{\beta}(h)$, varies. In table \ref{V_z_values} are shown the $n_z$ values of the variance of latent component; we can see that variability increases as the model complexity decreases. The reason is the following: if we decide to use a less number of covariates to describe the bike sharing phenomenon, then the descriptive power of $\boldsymbol{z}(\boldsymbol{s}, t)$ increases in order to cope with what the global component $\boldsymbol{x}(\boldsymbol{s}, t, h)' \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}(h)$ is not able to explain due to reduction of the model complexity.

We have decided to describe in detail the \textit{medium model}, a fair compromise between complexity and relevance of the latent component.

\subsubsection{Model parameters}
After having estimated the parameters of the medium model, we have performed the $\chi^2$-test to evaluate the significance of the regressors. Results are shown in table \ref{Chi2_p_values}: all p-values are less than \SI{5}{\percent}, therefore we can conclude all functions $\boldsymbol{\beta}(h)$ related to the chosen covariates are significantly different from zero and consequently give their contribute to explain $\mathit{y}(\boldsymbol{s}, \textit{t}, \textit{h})$, i.e. the number of hourly pickups at a rental station.

\noindent
In the figure \ref{Trend_beta_M}, instead, we have reported the daily trend of the estimated functions $\boldsymbol{\beta}(h)$ and the variance of $\epsilon$, i.e. $\sigma_{\epsilon}(h)$. It is interesting the trend of $\beta_{const}(h)$ which expresses the mean number of daily pickups during the day; there are two peaks that probably are related with start and end work times. All others variables contribute positively in explaining $y(\boldsymbol{s}, t, h)$, except for the distance and the dummy lockdown; the negative trend of the former is correlated to the fact that as the distance from the nearest subway/train station increases an individual is less incentivized to use bike, that of the latter, instead, is caused to the impossibility to leave own home during the Pause Program in NYC. Moreover, $\beta_{lockdown}$ is also highly uncertain because it's different from zero for only few days. Finally, analysing the behaviour of $\sigma_{\epsilon}(h)$ we can note the estimated model performs worse around 20 o'clock.
