\subsubsection{Model selection}
In order to choose  parsimonious models with good performance, two different types of models are considered, namely, Full models, which contain all the available covariates (weather, distances, lockdown, holiday), and Selected models, which include only those covariates that are significant. 

The model selection was carried out on the univariate spatio-temporal process related to pickups, on the univariate spatio-process process related to trip duration and on the bivariate spatio-temporal process (pickup, trip duration).
After obtaining the various models, we want to evaluate their performance in comparison to the full models and their predictive ability through the Cross Validation.(Table \ref{Cross-validation mean squared errors DCM}).

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.3}
	\begin{tabular}{c|cc|cc}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{1}{l|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\textit{Full}} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Selected} }\\ 
		\hline
		\textbf{CV MSE} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{pickups }} & \textbf{duration} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{pickups}} & \textbf{duration} \\ 
		\hline
		\textbf{2-variate } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0.9870}  & 0.9624   & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0.6584}  & 0.8221   \\

		\textbf{1-variate } & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0.4654}  & 0.7825   & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{0.6685}  & 0.7868   \\

\end{table}

The  table \ref{Log-likelihoods DCM} compares the likelihood models and we can see the pickups selective univariate model have the lowest log-likelihoods while the bivariate selected model have the highest.

\subsubsection{Model analysis}

In the figure \ref{Trend_zeta_latente univariato} shows the trend of the latent z interacting with the covariates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $z_{1}$, which indicates the trend of the pickups is a significant variable that has a positive effect both on the number of rentals and on the average daily rental duration.
	\item $z_{2}$, which indicates the distance. The trend is always positive therefore it brings a decrease in the number of pickups
	\item $z_{3}$ , which indicates the holidays and not affect the increase of pickups.
\end{itemize}

In the figure \ref{Trend_zeta_latente} shows the trend of the latent z interacting with the covariates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $z_{1}$, which indicates the trend of the pickups.
	\item $z_{2}$, is refers to the distance. in comparison to the univariate case it can be noted  an decrease in pickups.
	\item $z_{3}$ , which indicates the trend of the average of trip duration
	\item $z_{4}$ , which indicates the distance and not affect the increase of the average trip duration.
\end{itemize}

The most significant coefficients $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}}$ are shown in the  table \ref{z_latent trend}, it can be seen that both models the most significant coefficients are $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}_{temp}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\hat{\beta}_{UV}}$
